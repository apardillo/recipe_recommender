Sprinkle the yeast and about 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Let the mixture stand for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until foamy.
Add the remaining sugar, salt, egg, shortening, and the melted butter. Stir with a wooden spoon until incorporated.
Add the flour, and using the dough hook, slowly beat the mixture on low until the flour is moistened.
Turn the speed to medium-high and beat the dough for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the dough gathers in the center and pulls from the side of the bowl.
If the dough is still very sticky after 10 minutes of kneading, sprinkle a little bit of flour to help with the stickiness.
Place the dough in a bowl and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let it rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Meanwhile, make the second dough. Mix the softened butter and shortening together using the back of the spoon until creamy and smooth. Gradually stir in the flour and keep mixing until a smooth and soft dough forms.
Deflate the risen first dough and turn it over on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick, with the long edge facing you.
Fold the upper third of the dough towards the center, then fold the lower third over to the center. Fold both the left and right sides of the dough towards the center to form a rectangular ""envelope"" shape.
Roll the dough into a rectangle again, about 1/4 inch-thick. Using an angled spatula, spread the second dough over the rolled first dough until well-distributed.
Fold the dough again in the same way. Roll it out again into a rectangle as thin as possible without tearing.
Starting on the long edge, roll the dough into a tight log.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Use a knife to slice the dough into 1/2-inch portions. Take one portion, and roll it out very thinly (paper-thin) into an oval shape. Lightly dust the rolling pin to keep the dough from sticking.
Carefully dip the shaped dough on a plate of white sugar to coat. Repeat with remaining dough portions.

Add the flour gradually while stirring, adding only enough until the dough has gathered in the center of the bowl. It should still be soft and not dry. You may not need the entire amount of flour.
Turn the dough over on a floured surface and knead until smooth, elastic, and has lost some of its stickiness. Use some of the remaining flour to prevent the dough from sticking too much on the board or on hands.

Once risen, gently deflate the dough and divide it into 4 equal portions. Divide each portion into 4 smaller equal portions for a total of 16 pieces.
Using the palm of hands or a rolling pin, flatten each portion to form a rectangular dough about 6 inches in length and 4-inches in width.

Take 1 part of the pie dough and place it on a floured surface. Roll it out thinly to fit a 28×4 cm pie pan with additional inch allowance for the edges. 
Gently fold the rolled dough in half and then in a quarter. Place the dough on top of the pie pan with the pointed part precisely in the middle. Unfold the pie dough and gently fit the dough on the bottom and sides of the plate without tearing it. 
Using kitchen shears, trim dough to a 1-inch overhang; fold under, and press gently to seal. Crimp edges if desired. Refrigerate 30 minutes to an hour before using.
Take the remaining half of the dough and roll it forming a circle with the same diameter as the top of the pie pan (28cm). Place the dough on parchment paper and roll it together into a cylinder. Refrigerate until ready to use. ","flour salt lard water lemon juice vinegar cornstarch coconut water purpose cream sugar coconut meat egg milk bowl sift flour salt

399,Pan de Coco,"4 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 ounce instant dry yeast, 1 1/4 cups lukewarm milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 cups desiccated coconut, 3/4 cup brown sugar, unpacked, 1 cup milk or coconut milk, 1 cup water, 3 tablespoons butter, 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon flour, dissolved in 1/4 cup milk, 1 egg, beaten, 1 tablespoon water","In a large bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. 
Add the instant dry yeast and mix. 
Add the lukewarm milk, vegetable oil, and salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, mix until it sticks together and forms a dough.
Turn the dough on a flat surface and knead for 5 minutes. Avoid adding more flour or the bread will be too dense and crumbly. If it is too sticky, apply some oil on your hands to prevent the dough from sticking.  If it is too dry, add a bit of oil to the dough. As you continue kneading, the dough should be less and less tacky and easier to handle.
Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Leave it to rise for 30 minutes to an hour or until it has almost doubled its size.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling. In a pan, combine desiccated coconut, brown sugar, coconut milk, water, butter, and vanilla extract. Over low heat, bring to a simmer.
Cook until liquid is mostly absorbed. If you prefer filling to be more compact and sticky (not crumbly), add 1 tablespoon flour dissolved in 1/4 cup of milk after the liquid has been absorbed. Continue to cook, stirring regularly, for another 2-3 minutes or until thick and sticky. 
Remove filling from heat and allow to slightly cool. 
Gently deflate the dough and tip it to a flat surface. Roll into a log and cut into half. Roll each half again and cut into two. Divide each log into 6 equal parts for a total of 24 pieces.
Cover the dough pieces with a kitchen towel and let rest for at least 3-5 minutes.
Flatten each dough with the palm of the hand. Hold the flattened dough in the curve of your hand and add about 1 tablespoon of coconut filling in the center. Pinch the corners together to fully enclose the filling.  
Arrange the filled dough, pinched side down, on a baking sheet at about 1 inch apart.
Using a fork, poke small holes in the center of each filled dough. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let them rest for another 20-30 minutes.
