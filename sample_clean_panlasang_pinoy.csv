Once the oil is hot, saute the garlic and onion.
Add the chicken breast then cook until color turns light brown (about 5 minutes)
Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, and Knorr chicken cube. Stir and cover the pot. Cook for 5 minutes.
Put-in carrots and potatoes. Cook for another 5 minutes
Add the green peas, raisins, and sugar then simmer for 3 minutes
Season with salt and ground black pepper. Turn off the heat, drain the excess liquid, and set aside.
Make the dough by combining the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl starting with the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix well using a wire whisk.
Cut the butter into small thin pieces place in the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients.(the butter should be cold and solid before doing this)
Add water gradually and mix all the ingredients thoroughly until a dough is formed. You may use a pastry blender to ease the process.
Divide the dough into individual pieces by grabbing a piece from the whole mixture and rolling it in your hand until a spherical shape is formed. Do this until all the dough is consumed. Set aside in a cool place for at least 20 minutes
Flatten the spherical dough by pressing it with your palm against a flat surface. Use a rolling pin to flatten it fully while creating a round shape.
Arrange about a quarter to half a cup of filling (the chicken that you cooked in the first few steps) at the middle of the flattened dough. Fold the dough so that opposite ends meet (you should have formed a half moon shaped dough)then press the edges and seal. (refer to the video for the technique)
After all the fillings are consumed, crack the egg and separate the white from the yolk. Beat the egg white lightly and mix a little water.Glaze the crust by brushing the egg wash.
Put a wax paper on top of a baking tray or grease the baking tray then arranged the sealed doughs.
Pre-heat oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes. Bake the sealed doughs for 25 minutes at the same temperature.
Remove from the oven.
Serve hot.

Cut the butter into small thin pieces place in the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients.(the butter should be cold and solid before doing this)
Add water gradually and mix all the ingredients thoroughly until a dough is formed. You may use a pastry blender to ease the process.
Divide the dough into individual pieces by grabbing a piece from the whole mixture and rolling it in your hand until a spherical shape is formed. Do this until all the dough is consumed. Set aside in a cool place for at least 20 minutes
Flatten the spherical dough by pressing it with your palm against a flat surface. Use a rolling pin to flatten it fully while creating a round shape.
Arrange about a quarter to half a cup of filling (the chicken that you cooked in the first few steps) at the middle of the flattened dough. Fold the dough so that opposite ends meet (you should have formed a half moon shaped dough)then press the edges and seal. (refer to the video for the technique)
After all the fillings are consumed, crack the egg and separate the white from the yolk. Beat the egg white lightly and mix a little water.Glaze the crust by brushing the egg wash.
